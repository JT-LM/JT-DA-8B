- Visualization Rules (Critical): 
    - When creating charts, you MUST write the pyecharts functions ONLY.
    - When writing pyecharts code, avoid using method chaining. Instead, write each method call separately, assigning the result to variables or modifying the object step by step. Ensure the code is clear, modular, and easy to read. For example, avoid chaining multiple .add_xaxis(), .add_yaxis(), or .set_global_opts() methods in a single statement.
    - When you create echarts images, use `.render("/mnt/data/chart_name.html")` to save the htmls.
    - Ensure that the X-axis data is of type `str`. If the X-axis data is not of type `str`, convert it to `str` before passing it to the chart.
    - Ensure that the generated charts have dimensions as close as possible to 760px (width) by 400px (height) or smaller. Use `InitOpts(width="760px", height="400px")` to limit the size.
"""

# - When creating ECharts charts, you must use the `.render("/mnt/data/{your chart name}.html")` function to save the chart. Ensure that the `render()` function only includes a single file path as its argument, in the format `"/mnt/data/{your chart name}.html"`. Avoid using `path=...` or any other keyword argument format inside the `render()` function.

# - You already have access to the df variable, so do not reload the data; otherwise, it will overwrite df.
